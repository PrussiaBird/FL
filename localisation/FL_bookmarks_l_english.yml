 Fatherland_1964_DESC:0 "The treaties symbolising the end of World War 2 have transformed our planet into a complex system of hatred, discretion and uncertainty. Germany setting up Puppet States in Europe, the United States slowly spreads its influence in the Americas and Asia, the British government in exile struggles to stay afloat, and the new communist order in China strengthens. Will the cold war turn hot?"
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great Wars, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 GER_Fatherland_1964_DESC:0 "Germany was the main victorious power in the Second World War. After a peace was signed between Britain and Germany in 1944, German dominance was cemented in Europe. Various German-Friendly governments were installed in nations across the Continent. However, the war was only over in Europe. Less than a year later, the United States dropped 2 Atomic bombs on Japan, forcing their surrender. America and Germany soon entered into a Cold war. The Führer is also getting old, and many factions are already anticipating Hitler's death, ready to take power for themselves. What happens next could change the course of History."
 SOV_Fatherland_1964_DESC:0 "The War had proven costly for the USSR, being pushed back to the Urals and losing the majority of their population and land. As the war in Europe came to a close, the USSR still fought on in a desperate Guerrilla campaign. Despite doing some Damage to the Wehrmacht as a whole, it could not last forever. Stalin's Successor, Nikita Kruschev, Brokered a deal with China, leading to the Astana Agreement between the USSR, PRC, and Germany. the agreement effectively made the USSR a vassal state of China and handed to China a number of lands, most notably, Outer Manchuria."
 PRC_Fatherland_1964_DESC:0 "After the surrender of the Empire of Japan in 1945, China no longer had a common enemy to focus its attention. The civil war began as it had before and by 1949, the war was turning in the favour of the Communists, the Nationalists retreated into the mountains of Xinjiang and Tibet. The war was now effectively over with the Communists victorious. Mao Zedong has began on a project of mass industrialization and many suspect that untold numbers of civilians have already perished. The Nationalists are also growing more bold, with an attack happening even as far as Nanking, Perhaps the war's end is yet to come."
